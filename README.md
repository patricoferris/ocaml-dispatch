ocaml-dispatch -- bindings to Apple's Grand Central Dispatch
------------------------------------------------------------
*Status: Experimental & WIP*
 
These are OCaml bindings for Apple's Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) library.

This project is heavily influenced by [ocaml-uring](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-uring/). In particular the copying tests (framework and `lwtcp`) are taken directly from that repository. (TODO: attribute this properly in the code).
